Install and use the app, executing all functions at least once. Data can be generated when entered by the user, sent by the endpoint, or shipped with the app.

- Check both internal and external local storage for any files created by the application that contain sensitive data.

- Identify development files, backup files, and old files that shouldn't be included with a production release.

- Check the permissions of the files inÂ `/data/data/<package-name>`. Only the user and group created when you installed the app (e.g., u0_a82) should have user read, write, and execute permissions (`rwx`). Other users should not have permission to access files, but they may have execute permissions for directories.
